# ToneScope - Audio Analysis & Mastering Tool

## Project Overview
ToneScope is a professional web-based audio analysis and mastering tool built for music producers. It enables users to analyze album tracks for tonal balance, dynamic range, and stereo imaging, while also providing non-destructive audio processing capabilities for auditioning different mastering styles.

## Features

### Module 1: Analyzer
1. **Tonal Balance**: Overlaid frequency spectrum visualization of all tracks showing album-wide tonal consistency
2. **Dynamic Range**: Table displaying LUFS, True Peak, and Crest Factor for each track
3. **Stereo Image**: Visual analysis of stereo width and L/R correlation for each track

### Module 2: Tonal Palette
1. **One-Click Presets**: Four mastering presets with toggle-based workflow
   - âœ¨ Brighter: High-frequency boost for airy, modern sound
   - ðŸŒ™ Darker: High-frequency cut with low-end emphasis
   - ðŸ”¥ Vintage Warmth: Mid-range warmth with gentle top-end rolloff
   - âš¡ Modern Punch: Enhanced low-end and presence
2. **Custom EQ**: Interactive drag-and-drop EQ curve with biquad filter implementation
3. **Reference Matching**: Upload reference track and apply its EQ curve to selected track
4. **Waveform Playback**: Visual waveform with play/pause controls for A/B testing

### Module 3: Advanced Processing
1. **Multi-band Compressor**: Dynamic compression across low, mid, and high frequency bands
   - Auto-Tune Settings: Automatically optimize compressor parameters based on audio analysis
2. **Stereo Imaging**: Adjust stereo width from mono to ultra-wide
3. **Peak Limiter**: Final ceiling control for optimal loudness
4. **Unified Processing**: Global "Process Audio" button applies all enabled effects sequentially

## How It Works

### Audio Analysis Pipeline
1. Files uploaded via drag-and-drop or file selector
2. Audio loaded using librosa with support for stereo/mono files
3. Frequency spectrum calculated using STFT with logarithmic binning
4. Dynamic range metrics computed using pyloudnorm and numpy
5. Stereo image analyzed using mid/side processing
6. Results visualized with Chart.js and rendered in responsive tables

### Unified Processing Workflow
1. User selects track and enables desired effects via toggle switches
2. Effects configuration:
   - **Tonal Preset/Custom EQ**: Radio buttons for preset selection or draggable EQ curve
   - **Multi-band Compressor**: Individual controls per band with auto-tune capability
   - **Stereo Imaging**: Width slider for stereo field adjustment
3. "Process Audio" button triggers sequential effect application:
   - Tonal balance (preset or custom EQ with biquad peaking filters)
   - Multi-band compression (dynamic processing per frequency band)
   - Stereo imaging (mid/side manipulation)
   - Peak normalization (final ceiling limiter)
4. Processed files saved as WAV with descriptive naming
5. Waveform visualization updates for immediate playback and A/B comparison
