# ToneScope - Audio Analysis & Mastering Tool

## Project Overview
ToneScope is a professional web-based audio analysis and mastering tool built for music producers. It enables users to analyze album tracks for tonal balance, dynamic range, and stereo imaging, while also providing non-destructive audio processing capabilities for auditioning different mastering styles.

## Features

### Module 1: Analyzer
1. **Tonal Balance**: Overlaid frequency spectrum visualization of all tracks showing album-wide tonal consistency
2. **Dynamic Range**: Table displaying LUFS, True Peak, and Crest Factor for each track
3. **Stereo Image**: Visual analysis of stereo width and L/R correlation for each track

### Module 2: Tonal Palette
1. **One-Click Presets**: Four mastering presets for instant A/B comparison
   - âœ¨ Brighter: High-frequency boost for airy, modern sound
   - ðŸŒ™ Darker: High-frequency cut with low-end emphasis
   - ðŸ”¥ Vintage Warmth: Mid-range warmth with gentle top-end rolloff
   - âš¡ Modern Punch: Enhanced low-end and presence
2. **Reference Matching**: Upload reference track and apply its EQ curve to selected track
3. **Waveform Playback**: Visual waveform with play/pause controls for A/B testing

## How It Works

### Audio Analysis Pipeline
1. Files uploaded via drag-and-drop or file selector
2. Audio loaded using librosa with support for stereo/mono files
3. Frequency spectrum calculated using STFT with logarithmic binning
4. Dynamic range metrics computed using pyloudnorm and numpy
5. Stereo image analyzed using mid/side processing
6. Results visualized with Chart.js and rendered in responsive tables

### Tonal Processing
1. User selects track from dropdown
2. Presets apply custom EQ curves using biquad filters
3. Reference matching extracts spectral envelope and applies to target
4. Processed files saved as WAV for download
5. Waveform visualization updates for immediate playback

## API Endpoints
